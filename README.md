# Passport Authentication Strategies





### Overview
This project is an example of a web application with user authentication implemented using Passport.js. It supports both local (username and password) and Google OAuth2.0 authentication strategies.
### Features
* Local Authentication: Users can register with a username and password. Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt.

* Google OAuth2.0 Authentication: Users can also log in using their Google accounts via OAuth2.0. This is achieved using Passport.js with the Google strategy.

* Session Management: The application utilizes express-session and connect-mongo for session management. User sessions are stored in MongoDB, ensuring persistence across server restarts.
